It then transitions to a city street that includes a road, a coffee shop, and a crosswalk sign. As cars drive by, our main character enters the scene and approaches the crosswalk. He looks at the crosswalk sign, and as it remains on the Don't Walk signal, the animation alternates between shots of him and the sign to emphasize his growing frustration. When the sign finally turns green, the character smiles. However, as he starts to cross the street, a car suddenly drives in and hits him" him, sending him flying.

                    a painting of a wrestling ring viewed from the ringside.
                    I started by sketching a base idea of the angle I wanted the ring to be,
                    and then, using rulers, I made a rough draft on canvas. After that, I
                    painted all of the red and black objects; after that, to add texture, I cut up
                    and layered painter's tape for the ropes to make them look like actual
                    ropes that are taped as well. After that, I used some splatter of red paint
                    to give the effect that the ring had been used.
                    I faced a challenge in creating this, much like my other piece of
                    traditional art, and I am much more comfortable with digital art. This
                    was one of many challenges, as I only realized these were watercolours
                    partially through, so on the painting itself, the paints are used more like
                    acrylic than watercolour. I didn't, per se, solve this challenge, but I
                    adapted to the change and still focused on delivering the best product
                    with the available tools"
